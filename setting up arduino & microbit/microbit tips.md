<!-- micro:bit tips -->

1. **To see a block's details:** right-click on the block --> click 'Help' --> Help window pops up!
- this 'Help' feature is _awesome_ -- it tells you how to write the code snippet with blocks, Javascript, and Python, what the parameters (inputs to the function) are, what the function returns (output), and gives an example (that you can even run right in your web browser)
2. **Delete a block/section of blocks:** drag the block(s) back to the vertical toolbar with your cursor --> a trash bin icon will appear --> release your mouse/trackpad to 'drop' the block(s) into the trash bin
