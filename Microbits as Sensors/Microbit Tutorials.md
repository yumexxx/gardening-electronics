All of these tutorials are for the microbit V2. The microbit V2 has some upgrades compared to the V1, but it's likely very easy to do these same features on the V1!

# [Data Logging](https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/data-logging/)
Learn to record data every *x* seconds and how to access it for for later analysis. This will be crucial to see the conditions the garden is experiencing overtime!

# Light
## [Light Sensor](https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/sunlight-sensor/)
Learn to use the light reader on the microbit.
- We don't need to do the entire 'if...else' statement in this code. We just wanted to show the light level feature!

# Temperature
## [Thermometer](https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/thermometer/)
Use the microbit's sensor to measure the temperature!

## [Fahrenheit Thermometer](https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/fahrenheit-thermometer/)
Learn how to use a simple function to convert the readings from the microbit's temperature sensor to Fahrenheit! (If we wanted, we could also convert it to Celsius if we wanted!)
