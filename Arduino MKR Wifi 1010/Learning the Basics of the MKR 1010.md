These are the tutorials that we followed in order to learn and get familiar with Arduinos (especially because we both had no prior experience with them!) If you follow these it will definitely enhance your skills.

**NOTE**: There are additional tutorials that you can feel free to follow if you would like! Not all are necessary for the functions we will be using the Arduino MKR for, so we are focusing on the ones that we think are important!
- Here are [all of the tutorials](https://explore-iot.arduino.cc/?_gl=1*1d5t7n8*_ga*MjA0Nzk2NjY1MC4xNjU0ODY3MDU2*_ga_NEXN8H46L5*MTY1NjQyMjU4My4xMy4xLjE2NTY0Mjk0ODguNDQ.)

General Info about using the [IoT Cloud](https://docs.arduino.cc/cloud/iot-cloud/tutorials/iot-cloud-getting-started?_gl=1*1dkilw2*_ga*MjA0Nzk2NjY1MC4xNjU0ODY3MDU2*_ga_NEXN8H46L5*MTY1NjQyMjU4My4xMy4xLjE2NTY0Mjc4NTIuNDg.)

### [Get to Know the Kit](https://explore-iot.arduino.cc/iotsk/module/iot-starter-kit/lesson/get-to-know-the-kit)
Learn how to record temperature and humidity locally by reading the HTS221 sensor that the MKR IoT Carrier comes equipped with!

### [Familiarizing with the IoT Dashboard and Recording Data](https://explore-iot.arduino.cc/iotsk/module/iot-starter-kit/lesson/get-to-know-the-kit)
Learn how to use the IoT Dashboard to help visualize data and save data from the Serial Monitor.

### [The Different Sensors included on the MKR 1010](https://explore-iot.arduino.cc/iotsk/module/iot-starter-kit/lesson/storing-our-data)
For this one, we **only** need to focus on the "Accessing all sensors on the MKR IoT Carrier," in order to learn all the features included in the MKR 1010. *The rest of the activity/information is irrelevant for what we will be doing.*

### [Creating a Minigame](https://explore-iot.arduino.cc/iotsk/module/iot-starter-kit/lesson/cloud-vs-carrier-game)
This minigame will teach you how to setup communication between the board and the cloud!
- If you would like to learn how to setup communication using another way (and not creating a game) [here is a tutorial](https://opla.arduino.cc/opla/module/iot-starter-kit-maker-long/lesson/thinking-about-you-long) that teaches you how to send messages between the board and the cloud.

### [Urban Farming](https://explore-iot.arduino.cc/iotsk/module/iot-starter-kit/lesson/urban-farming-101)
This is the final product of what we want to use the Arduinos for in our community garden! We use the sensors and moisture sensor attachment to analyze moisture, humidity, lighting, and temperature conditions of the garden beds.

**NOTES:**
- We will not be using the artificial light feature that is included within this tutorial. 
- Do **not** worry about the relay functions in this. We don't have anything to connect to the relays to activate (e.g. a fan or water pump), so we will not be using it. 
- There is [another tutorial](https://opla.arduino.cc/opla/module/iot-starter-kit-maker-long/lesson/smart-garden-long) that is very similar. Feel free to check it out!
