These are the tutorials that we followed in order to learn and get familiar with Arduinos (especially because we both had no prior experience with them!) If you follow these it will definitely enhance your skills.

*Note*: There are additional tutorials that you can feel free to follow if you would like! Not all are necessary for the functions we will be using the Arduino MKR for, so we are focusing on the ones that we think are important!
