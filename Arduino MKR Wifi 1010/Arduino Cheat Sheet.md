## Useful Arduino Libraries! 
- Arduino_MKRIoTCarrier.h 
	- https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/arduino_mkriotcarrier/  

## Tabs 
- ReadMe.adoc: text file containing information about the sketch, the author and the project – can/should edit for others’ reference! 
- thingProperties.h: this is code generated by Arduino IoT Cloud that shows which variables in the main sketch file will be synchronized with the cloud 
- Secret: this tab allows us to fill in the values for SECRET_SSID and SECRET_PASS, which are the name and password for the WiFi network our board will connect to 

## Basics 
- void setup(){} - a function that you create at the top of each program that contains code you want to run one time right when the program starts to run 
- void loop(){} - code that will loop forever as long as Arduino is powered 
- #include <library.h> or #include “library.h” - import libraries to use their functions! 
	-LibraryFile.h: when the angle brackets syntax is used, the libraries paths will be searched for the file. 
	-LocalFile.h: When the double quotes syntax is used, the folder of the file using the #include directive will be searched for the specified file, then the libraries paths if it was not found in the local path. Use this syntax for header files in the sketch’s folder. 
- pinMode(pin, mode) - configure a specific pin to behave either as an input or an output 
	- pin − the number of the pin whose mode you wish to set 
	- mode − INPUT, OUTPUT, or INPUT_PULLUP 
- Serial.begin(speed) - Sets the data rate in bits per second (baud) for serial data transmission 
	- Have been using a speed of 9600 
- delay("x" milliseconds) - makes the program pause for "x" milliseconds

## Other Notes 
- Make sure Arduino Create Agent is always open 
- If we are using the enclosure/casing, we must include code to calibrate the Arduino to take this into account 
	- CARRIER_CASE = true; //true bc using the enclosure 
	- carrier.begin(); 
- To disconnect cables from relay ports you need to use something to push inside the top square hole 
- APDS9960 ambient light sensor does not measure UV light, but can measure light intensity 


## Specifics to Urban Farming Code 
- When reading an analog component, we get a value between 0-1023 – the value range doesn’t make sense so we can simplify it using map() 
	- moistValue = map(rawMoistValue, 0, 1023, 100, 0); 
		- Changes range from 0-100 
		- Dry: low value 
		- Wet: high value
