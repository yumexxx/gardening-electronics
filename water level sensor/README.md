# Water Level Sensor
**Goal:** Let's use micro:bit's built in **accelerometer** to monitor the amount of water in a hydroponics system!

You have **lots of freedom** to construct your apparatus as you wish, keeping in mind the goal to detect amount of water in your system. Feel free to follow the example below, improve upon it, and/or create your own design!

### Materials
#### Electronics
- [ ] (1) micro:bit (with USB cord)
- [ ] (1) battery pack (for AA batteries) with connector
- [ ] (2) AA batteries
#### Craft Materials (see sub-bullets for example choices!)
- [ ] a base & frame for micro:bit and physical water sensor
	- [ ] (2) 1/2"-thick, 1 ft. long wooden rods (we cut these from one longer rod)
	- [ ] (1) 6" x 2" wooden block (1" thick)
- [ ] fasteners/something to connect parts considering desired movement (stability, rotation, etc.)
	- [ ] (2) long wood screws
	- [ ] (2) thin wooden skewers
- [ ] something to sense movement of water
	- [ ] (1) block of styrofoam (look around for packages with this!)
- [ ] something to hold the micro:bit, safe from water
	- [ ] scrap cardboard
	- [ ] tape

### Tools
- [ ] drill (with screw and woodboring bits)
- [ ] saw
- [ ] clamps (to secure wood while cutting/drilling)
- [ ] box cutter / scissors
- [ ] marker (to mark measurements/align parts)
- [ ] ruler (to fit apparatus to dimensions of hydroponics system)
