# Water Level Sensor :droplet:
**Goal:** Let's use micro:bit's built in **accelerometer** to monitor the amount of water in a hydroponics system!

<!-- insert diagram showing accelerometer on micro:bit -->

You have **lots of freedom** to construct your apparatus as you wish, keeping in mind the goal to detect amount of water in your system. Feel free to follow the example below, improve upon it, and/or create your own design!

### Materials
#### Electronics :battery:
- [ ] (1) micro:bit (with USB cord)
- [ ] (1) battery pack (for AA batteries) with connector
- [ ] (2) AA batteries
#### Craft Materials (see sub-bullets for example choices!) :art:
- [ ] a base & frame for micro:bit and physical water sensor
	- (2) 1/2"-thick, 1 ft. long wooden rods (we cut these from one longer rod)
	- (1) 6" x 2" wooden block (1" thick)
- [ ] fasteners/something to connect parts considering desired movement (stability, rotation, etc.)
	- (2) long wood screws
	- (2) thin wooden skewers
- [ ] something to sense movement of water
	- (1) block of styrofoam (look around for packages with this!)
- [ ] something to hold the micro:bit, safe from water
	- scrap cardboard
	- tape

### Tools :toolbox:
- [ ] drill (with screw and woodboring bits)
- [ ] saw
- [ ] clamps (to secure wood while cutting/drilling)
- [ ] box cutter / scissors
- [ ] marker (to mark measurements/align parts)
- [ ] ruler (to fit apparatus to dimensions of hydroponics system)

## Let's Build! :triangular_ruler:
1. Make a rough plan of your apparatus
	- will your structure be freestanding? attached to the hydroponics container?
	- how will you translate a physical sensor of water level to be detected as changing acceleration by the micro:bit?
	- what materials do you have available already to build a stable & durable structure? what materials can you easily get?

	Example:
	- with a small & light container, we chose to make the structure freestanding to ensure stability of the sensor over time without affecting the stability of the hydroponics system
	- stick a styrofoam block at one end of a skewer to sit in water, and attach the micro:bit at the other end of the skewer on a free-rotating piece of cardboard, so when the styrofoam floats on the surface of the water as its height changes, the micro:bit tilts up or down
	- we had some scrap wooden rods, wooden skewers, wood blocks and styrofoam lying around

2. Plan your dimensions and measure & mark materials
	- how tall and wide is your hydroponics system? how do you want your water level sensor positioned relative to the system (i.e. how far should the micro:bit be above to detect significant water level changes?)
	- how wide do you want your base to be to ensure a space-efficient & stable structure?

	Example:
	- the black bin pictured above is 10 inches wide and 8 inches tall
		- we wanted the micro:bit 6 inches above the top of the black container when the micro:bit is flat (parallel to the water surface), making the length between the micro:bit and styrofoam about 7 inches, so that the micro:bit and cardboard it's attached to have enough space to rotate down to be completely vertical (if the water level is extremely low)
	- we made our base 8 inches wide (slightly smaller than the width of the container), which seemed wide enough for stability, but did not take up much extra space outside of the system
	- we measured and marked:
		- location to attach

1. Construct frame and attach to base
