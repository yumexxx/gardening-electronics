# Let's get started with ESP32!

## What is ESP32?

According to Wikipedia, "ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth."
It is just like your Micro:bit! You can code it to take data from a sensor, or have it do things. 



It is suitable for gardening IoT because it connects to WiFi, and it can send it's data to the cloud (for example, to Arduino IoT cloud that we are using).
